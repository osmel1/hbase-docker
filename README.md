1. Use Git to clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the cloned repository and use Maven to build the JAR file by running  Maven command _mvn package_.
3. If you are a Windows or Mac user, ensure Docker Desktop is installed and running on your machine.
4. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the root directory of the cloned repository, and execute the command _docker-compose up -d_. This will start the Docker containers defined in the docker-compose.yml file in detached mode.
